# 💳 Financial Transactions Fraud Analysis

End-to-end financial data analysis and fraud detection project built using **SQL, Python, and Power BI**.

This project simulates a real-world analytics workflow on a large-scale transactional dataset (~3GB), focusing on data cleaning, behavioral analysis, and fraud pattern detection.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to:

- Clean and structure raw transactional data
- Analyze transaction behavior across regions and demographics
- Detect fraud patterns and risk indicators
- Build an interactive dashboard for insight communication

The project integrates database management, data analysis, and business intelligence tools into a single pipeline.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **SQL Server (SSMS)**
- **SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Data Cleaning Queries)**
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
- **pyodbc & SQLAlchemy**
- **Power BI**

---

## 🗄 Data Engineering (SQL Phase)

- Created structured relational database
- Imported and merged multiple CSV files
- Removed duplicates and invalid records
- Standardized categorical variables
- Converted data types (numeric & datetime)
- Filtered extreme outliers
- Built unified analytical views

---

## 🐍 Python Analysis Phase

- Connected Python to SQL database
- Performed secondary validation and cleaning
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed:

  - Transaction volumes by state and region
  - Online vs in-store behavior
  - Fraud rate by card type
  - Fraud rate by payment technology (chip, swipe, online)
  - Top users and merchants
  - Time-based trends (hourly, daily, monthly)

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

Built an interactive dashboard showing:

- Total transactions & fraud rate
- Fraud vs non-fraud distribution
- Fraud rate by card type
- Regional transaction activity
- Temporal trends
- Demographic breakdowns

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Online transactions showed higher fraud rates
- Chip-enabled cards had lower fraud likelihood
- Fraud losses were concentrated among a small group of users
- Transaction peaks occurred during evenings and weekends
